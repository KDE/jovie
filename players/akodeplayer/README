This is an aKode audio plugin for KTTS.

There are two problems right now (19 Jun 2005) that prevent this from being usable
for KTTS:

1.  There was a bug in aKode that prevents it from playing .wav files.  Carewolf
    applied a patch on 13 Jun 2005 to decoderpluginhandler.cpp for this,
    so you may need to update your kdemultimedia modules.

2.  aKode doesn't instantly stop when calling pause() or stop().
    See bug:107135.

If you want to try this plugin, add --enable-kttsd-akode to ./configure command.

If the problems above aren't addressed, this plugin should probably be removed
from KTTS.
