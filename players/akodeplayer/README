This is an aKode audio plugin for KTTS.

There are two problems right now (12 Jun 2005) that prevent this from being usable
for KTTS:

1.  There's a bug in aKode that prevents it from playing .wav files.  Apply
    decoderpluginhandler.diff to kdemultimedia/akode/lib/decoderpluginhandler.cpp
    and rebuild kdemultimedia/akode/lib.  Waiting for carewolf to apply this
    patch.

2.  aKode doesn't instantly stop when calling pause() or stop().
    See bug:107135.

If you want to try this plugin, add --enable-kttsd-akode to ./configure command.

If the problems above aren't addressed, this plugin should probably be removed
from KTTS.
