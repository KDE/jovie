2004-05-15  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Lots of changes:
        *   Defined the KDE Text-to-speech API.  See /libktts/kspeech.h.
        *   Moved all the GUI stuff out of KTTSD into kttsmgr.  KTTSD is a pure non-GUI deamon now.
        *   Added text job manager as a KPart (kttsjobmgr) for GUI interface.
        *   Replaced existing configuration manager (kcmkttsd) with kcmkttsmgr, which includes kttsjobmgr.
        *   Fixed several typos and minor bugs.
        *   Fixed Kate and KHTML Plugins.
        *   Updated README, TODO and this file.
        *
        * IMPORTANT note to developers using KTTSD:  The startText, stopText, resumeText DCOP
        *   methods now take a jobNum argument, which you can code as 0 to operate against the last text
        *   job your app queued.  See /plugins/kate-plugin/katekttsd.cpp for example, or /libktts/kspeech.h.
