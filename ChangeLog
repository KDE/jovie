        * FreeTTS plugin.
        
2004-08-28  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * GStreamer player added.  Doesn't work right now because gstreamer 0.6
          has issues with wav files.  Try again when KDE bindings (gst) have been
          updated to gstreamer 0.8.
        * If jobNum parameter in dcop calls is 0, default to last job queued by the
          application, or if no such job, the current job (instead of last job).
        * After call to stopText, if there more speakable jobs in the queue, they begin
          speaking.
        * Emit textPaused and textStopped signals as documented.
        * Fix bug in festivalint plugin.  Hangs sometimes with short utterances caused
          by writing to Stdin before Stdin buffer is empty.
        * Better sentence parsing.
        * Minor fixes to kttsjobmgrpart.
        
2004-08-09  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Remove requirement to copy pluginconf.h to $KDEDIR/include when running designer
          against plugin configuration widgets.
        * Epos plugin not listing codecs.
        * Some plugins listing codecs multiple times.
        * Select and ensure default language visible when first displaying kttsmgr.
        * Auto select and prepare Properties tab when adding a new language in kttsmgr.
        
2004-08-08  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Add plugin for Epos TTS Synthesis System (czech and slovak).
        
2004-08-07  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Existing release marked with tag ktts-0-1.
        * New version of KTTS is 0.2.
        * Many changes to KTTSD and the KTTSD plugins.
        * QThreads have been mostly eliminated, which were causing anomalies.
        * See libkttsd/pluginproc.h for the new plugin API.  The new API is backwards
          compatible to the old API.
        * Plugins now perform synthesis separate from audibilizing, but they may do
          both if needed.  If a plugin supports separate synthesis, it returns True
          in supportsSynth() method.
        * If a plugin supports separate synthesis, KTTSD sends the synthesized audio file
          to aRts for playback.  The playback code has been designed with future
          alternate playback plugins in mind, example gstreamer.  (The code was adapted
          from Juk with minor changes.)
        * Plugins may work asynchronously, provide status via state() method and emit
          signals when an operation has completed.  If a plugin supports asynchronous
          operation, it returns True in supportsAsync() method.
        * If a plugin does not support asynchronous operation, it is wrapped in a QThread,
          which is the same as before.  See threadedplugin.h/cpp.
        * Because playback is separate from synthesis and plugins work asynchronously,
          pauseText or stopText _immediately_ pause or stop playback in mid-sentence.
        * New plugin, flite, added for direct support of Festival Lite.
        * The festivalint, command, and hadifax plugins were rewritten to support
          these new capabilities.  
        * Need someone to rework the freetts plugin.  I don't have JVM.
        * Each plugin (except festival and freetts) now has a "Test" button on the
          configuration dialog.
        * The option to play a sound on text interruption now works.
          
2004-07-10  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Warn user if festival not installed.
        * Install voices data file for festival interactive plugin even if
          festival plugin not installed.

2004-06-05  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Draft KDE Text-to-Speech API Draft 3.
        * Removed concept of paragraphs.
        * Added concept of text job parts.
        * Added sayScreenReaderOutput method.
        * Replaced nextSenText, prevSenText, nextParText, prevParText with moveRelTextSentence.
        * Added jumpToTextPart.
        * Removed paragraph settings from configuration dialog.
        
2004-05-31  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Move speaking of notifications to KTTSD and persist notify settings.
        * Clean up kcmkttsmgr.desktop and install to correct place.
        
2004-05-23  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Add option to speak KNotify notifications.
        
2004-05-22  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Change menu item to "Speak Text" on the Tools menu in app-plugins.  Also start KTTSD if it is
          not running.

2004-05-21  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Bug fix.  Upon startup of kttsmgr, Remove button and Properties tab not enabled despite
          default language selected.
          
2004-05-19  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Allow kttsmgr screen to be resized as narrow as possible.
        * Correct some mispellings.
        * When calling reinit() pauseText only if isSpeakingText().
        
2004-05-18  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Reinit() without losing existing queued text jobs, messages, or warnings.
        * When kttsd restarts because of reinit(), job manager part refreshes list.

2004-05-17  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Fix hang when calling reinit() while speaking.
                        
2004-05-15  Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>
        * Lots of changes:
        *   Defined the KDE Text-to-speech API.  See /libktts/kspeech.h.
        *   Moved all the GUI stuff out of KTTSD into kttsmgr.  KTTSD is a pure non-GUI deamon now.
        *   Added text job manager as a KPart (kttsjobmgr) for GUI interface.
        *   Replaced existing configuration manager (kcmkttsd) with kcmkttsmgr, which includes kttsjobmgr.
        *   Fixed several typos and minor bugs.
        *   Fixed Kate and KHTML Plugins.
        *   Updated README, TODO and this file.
        *
        * IMPORTANT note to developers using KTTSD:  The startText, stopText, resumeText DCOP
        *   methods now take a jobNum argument, which you can code as 0 to operate against the last text
        *   job your app queued.  See /plugins/kate-plugin/katekttsd.cpp for example, or /libktts/kspeech.h.
