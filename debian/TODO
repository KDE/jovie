* Remove kcm_kttsd library once KMouth stops using it.
* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?
* I keep getting
    dpkg-gencontrol: warning: unknown substitution variable ${misc:Depends}
  should I just remove that from the control file?  (It was put there by
  dh_make.)
* Despite having moved libkttsd and libktts from kttsd.install to kttsd-dev.install,
  debuild still includes them in the package, and the kttsd-dev and kttsd-appplugins
  packages are essentially empty. ??
