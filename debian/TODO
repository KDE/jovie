* Here's my build procedure:
    - cvs2dist kdenonbeta kttsd --version 0.2.0
    - copy resulting kttsd-0.2.0.tar.gz to a work folder and rename to kttsd_0.2.0.orig.tar.gz
      (Note underscore)
    - unpack tarball
    - cd kttsd-0.2.0
    - cp -R kttsd/debian debian
    - debuild -uc -us
    
* dpkg-shlibdeps is reporting:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libktts.so.1
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1
  
* How do I do API doc symlinks?  This was in the initial package I built using
  dh_make:
    debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/HTML/en/kttsd-0.2.0-apidocs/common -> ../../../kde/HTML/en/common
  Currently, I get the following directory tree
    debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/kttsd-0.2.0-apidocs/common -> /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/common
    debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/kttsd-0.2.0-apidocs/kttsd/html/kttsd
  but the latter is empty, probably because I've turned off arch-indep in the rules
  file, and that appears to do the make apidox.  However, with that turned on,
  I get errors.

* lintian is reporting the following:
    W: kttsd source: changelog-should-mention-nmu
    W: kttsd source: source-nmu-has-incorrect-version-number 0.2.0
    W: kttsd-appplugins: missing-depends-line

* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?

* Add Handbook to kttsd.install file (symlinks?)

* Remove kcm_kttsd library once KMouth stops using it.
