* Here's my build procedure:
    - cd kdeaccessibility/doc/kttsd && make distclean && cd kdeaccessibility/kttsd && make distclean
    - If you have not installed kdelibs-dev for KDE 3.4:
        - Copy the following 2 files from kdelibs/interfaces/kspeech to $KDEDIR/include/:
            kspeech.h
            kspeechsink.h
        - Copy the following file from kdelibs/interfaces/kspeech to $KDEDIR/share/servicetypes/:
            dcoptexttospeech.desktop
    - cvs2dist kdeaccessibility kttsd --version 0.3.0
    - Copy resulting kttsd-0.3.0.tar.gz to a work folder and rename to kttsd_0.3.0.orig.tar.gz
      (Note underscore)
    - Unpack tarball
    - cd kttsd-0.3.0
    - rm -fR autom4te.cache
    - cp -R kttsd/debian debian
    - Add --enable-debug=full --enable-kttsd-gstreamer to configure line in rules
    - debuild -uc -us

* dpkg-shlibdeps is reporting:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1

* lintian is reporting the following:
    W: kttsd-appplugins: missing-depends-line

* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?

* debuild is ending like this.  Why:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1
