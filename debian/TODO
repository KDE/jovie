* Here's my build procedure:
    - cvs2dist kdenonbeta kttsd --version 0.2.0
    - copy resulting kttsd-0.2.0.tar.gz to a work folder and rename to kttsd_0.2.0.orig.tar.gz
      (Note underscore)
    - unpack tarball
    - cd kttsd-0.2.0
    - cp -R kttsd/debian debian
    - debuild -uc -us
    
* dpkg-shlibdeps is reporting:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libktts.so.1
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1
  
* Problems including the API docs.
    1.  Must add the line
          include $(top_srcdir)/admin/Doxyfile.am
        to root-level Makefile.am.
    2.  The debuild-generated Makefile defines target apidox as apidox-no.
        I'm not clear why this is.  If I do
          cd kttsd-0.2.0
          ./configure
          cd kttsd
          make apidox
        it generates the API docs.  This has to be done as user kde-devel
        who has KDEDIR=/home/share/kde-unstable and won't work for user gary
        who has KDEDIR=/usr.
  For now I have the "indep" targets commented out in debian/rules,
  so debuild will run to completion.

* lintian is reporting the following:
    W: kttsd-appplugins: missing-depends-line

* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?

* Remove kcm_kttsd library once KMouth stops using it.
