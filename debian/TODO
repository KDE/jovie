    cdbs           0.4.26-1.1     common build system for Debian packages

* Here's my build procedure (note that I'm using CDBS):
    - cd kdeaccessibility/doc/kttsd && make distclean && cd kdeaccessibility/kttsd && make distclean
    - cvs2dist kdeaccessibility kttsd --version 0.3.0
    - Copy resulting kttsd-0.3.0.tar.gz to a work folder and rename to kttsd_0.3.0.orig.tar.gz
      (Note underscore)
    - Unpack tarball
    - cd kttsd-0.3.0
    - rm -fR autom4te.cache
    - cp -R kttsd/debian debian
    - debuild -uc -us

* dpkg-shlibdeps is reporting:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1
  Should I have libkttsd.so in the .install file?

* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?

* For unknown reason, several of the doc translations aren't being built (da, pt for example),
  but en and de are being built. ??
