* In order to successfully build apidocs, you need package qt3-doc installed.
  FWIW, I have the following packages installed (among many others, of course):

* Here's my build procedure:
    - cvs2dist kdenonbeta kttsd --version 0.2.0
    - copy resulting kttsd-0.2.0.tar.gz to a work folder and rename to kttsd_0.2.0.orig.tar.gz
      (Note underscore)
    - unpack tarball
    - cd kttsd-0.2.0
    - rm -fR autom4te.cache
    - rm INDEX
    - cp -R kttsd/debian debian
    - Add the following line to end of Makefile.am
        include $(top_srcdir)/admin/Doxyfile.am
    - Add --enable-debug=full to configure line in rules
    - debuild -uc -us
    
* dpkg-shlibdeps is reporting:
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libktts.so.1
    dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find path for libkttsd.so.1
  
* In order to get the apidocs to debuild, I had to change the rules file
  compared to the one in kdeaccessibility as follows:
    109c109
    <       #cd $(objdir) && \
    ---
    >       cd $(objdir) && \
    218,219c218,221
    < binary-indep: build-indep install-indep
    <       $(MAKE) -f debian/rules DH_OPTIONS=-i binary-common
    ---
    > binary-indep: build-indep
    >
    > # binary-indep: build-indep install-indep
    > #     $(MAKE) -f debian/rules DH_OPTIONS=-i binary-common

* lintian is reporting the following:
    W: kttsd-appplugins: missing-depends-line

* Should rc files be installed to etc/ tree?

* Remove kcm_kttsmgr library once KMouth stops using it.
