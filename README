KTTS -- KDE Text-to-Speech -- is a subsystem within the KDE desktop
for conversion of text to audible speech. KTTS is currently under
development and aims to become the standard subsystem for all KDE
applications to provide speech output. Currently, KTTS consists of
the following components:

KTTSD
  The KDE Text-to-Speech Deamon, a non-gui application that runs in
the background, providing TTS support to KDE applications. Applications
initiate TTS by making DCOP calls to kttsd.

KTTSMGR
  An application for configuring the KTTS System and for managing in-progress
speech jobs. kttsmgr provides an icon in the system tray for performing
these functions as needed.

kttsjobmgr
  A KPart for managing in-progress speech jobs.

kcmkttsd
  A KControl module for configuring the KTTS System. kcmkttsd runs in the
KDE Control Center or start it with the command "kcmshell kcmkttsd".

ktexteditor_kttsd
  A plugin for the KDE Advanced Text Editor that permits you to speak an entire
text file or any portion of a file.

khmtl-plugin
  A plugin for Konqueror that permits you to speak all or any portion of an
HTML web page.  (Note: this component is in kdebase/konqueror/kttsplugin)

User features:
  * Speak contents of a text file.
  * Speak KDE notification events (KNotify).
  * Speak all or part of the text of a web page in Konqueror.
  * Speak all or part of the text in Kate text editor, including
    instances where Kate is embedded in another KDE application.
  * Long text is parsed into sentences. User may backup by sentence
    or paragraph, replay, pause, and stop playing.
  * Filter plugins for converting chat emoticons to speakable words,
    fix mispronunciations, and convert xhtml to SSML.
  * Audio output via aRts, ALSA, GStreamer (version 0.8.7 or later),
    or aKode.

Programmer features:
  * Priority system for screen reader outputs, warnings and messages,
    while still playing regular texts.
  * Plugin-based architecture for support of a wide variety of speech
    synthesis engines and drivers.
  * Permit generation of speech from the command line (or via shell scripts)
    using the KDE DCOP utilities.
  * Provide a lightweight and easily usable interface for applications
    to generate speech output.
  * Applications need not be concerned about contention over the speech device.
  * FUTURE: Provide support for speech markup languages, such as VoiceXML, Sable,
    Java Speech Markup Language (JSML), and Speech Markup Meta-language (SMML).
  * FUTURE: Provide limited support for embedded speech markers.
  * Asynchronous to prevent system blocking.

Requirements
------------
KDE 3.2 or greater and a speech synthesis engine, such as Festival.  Festival
can be obtained from http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/.  Festival
is distributed with most Linux distros.  Check your distro CDs.  Also works
with Hadifix, Epos, Festival Lite (flite), FreeTTS, or any command that can
speak text.

Optional Components
-------------------
  * The sox utility is needed for adjusting overall speech rate.
  * The xsltproc utility is needed for SSML support.
  * GStreamer 0.8.7 or greater.

See the KTTS Handbook

  (http://accessibility.kde.org/developer/kttsd/handbook/index.html)

for complete instructions on installing, compiling, configuring, and using
KTTS.

Audio Plugins
-------------
KTTS can be built with the following audio plugins.  The "Default Configure
"Option" column shows the default option for the configure command.
The "Alternate" column gives the opposite configure option:

  System     Plugin        Default Configure Option  Alternate
  ------     ------------  ------------------------- ------------------------
  aRts       artsplayer    --with-arts               --without-arts
  ALSA       alsaplayer    --with-alsa=check         --with-alsa=no
  GStreamer  gstplayer     --with-gstreamer=no       --with-gstreamer=check
  aKode      akodeplayer   --with-akode=no           --with-akode=check

You *must* have at least one of these plugins for KTTS to work.

The aKode and GStreamer players are not built by default because they have issues
with instant stopping and starting.

Packager Notes
--------------
The following speech synthesizer plugins are all built by default.
Some of them are runtime only dependent upon non-free software.
(Non-free according to Debian Policy). The "Configure Option to
not build" column shows the configure command to not build the plugin:

  Synth          License   Configure Option to not build
  -------------  --------  -----------------------------
  Festival       free      --disable-kttsd-festivalint
  Festival Lite  free      --disable-kttsd-flite
  Epos           free      --disable-kttsd-epos
  Command        free      --disable-kttsd-command
  Hadifix        non-free  --disable-kttsd-hadifix
  FreeTTS        non-free  --disable-kttsd-freetts

IMPORTANT NOTE TO BINARY PACKAGERS:
Please do not distribute binary packages of kdeaccessibility with the
gstreamer plugin, as this creates unwanted dependencies.  Instead,
distribute the gstreamer plugin in a separate package, e.g.
kde-accessibility-extras.  The separate package should require
gstreamer >= 0.8.7.  Thank you.
