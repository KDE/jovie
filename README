KTTSD is the next Proklam.
The first difference is that KTTSD is implemented as a KDED module.
It is based on Proklam and depricates Proklam.

KTTSD, KDE Text To Speech Daemon is a plug-in based dcop service that
allows any KDE (or non-KDE) application to send messages using the
dcop interface that later will be spoken.

Features
--------
* Priority system for warnings and messages, while still playing regular texts.
* Long text is parsed into sentences.  User may backup by sentence or paragraph,
  replay, pause, and stop playing.
* Speak contents of clipboard.

Requirements
------------
KDE 3.2.x and a speech synthesis engine, such as Festival.  Festival can be
obtained from http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/.  Festival is
distributed with most Linux distros.  Check your distro CDs.  Also works
with Hadifax or any command that can speak text, such as Festival Lite
(flite).

Building
--------
If you are building from CVS kdenonbeta module, the usual commands

  cd kdenonbeta
  echo kttsd > inst-apps
  make -f Makefile.cvs
  ./configure
  make
  make install  // as root

Before attempting to run QT Designer against plugin .ui files, first copy
kttsd/libkttsd/pluginconf.h to $KDEDIR/include/.
  
Using
-----
Make sure your speech engine is working.

You may need to grant Festival write access to the audio device.

  chmod a+rw /dev/dsp*

To configure the speech plugin for KTTSD

  kcmshell kcmkttsd
  
If using the Festival or Festival Interactive plugins, you'll need to
specify the path to the voices.  On most systems, this will be

  /usr/share/festival/voices
  
or

  /usr/local/share/festival/voices

Be sure to click the Default button after configuring a speech
plugin!

To run KTTSD

  kttsd

Click on the system tray icon.  Click "Open text to read out" button, 
pick a plain text file, then click "Start reading" button.

To set the text to be spoken

 dcop kttsd kspeech setText <text> <language>

where <text> is the text to be spoken, and <language> is a language code
such as "en", "cy", etc.

Example.

  dcop kttsd kspeech setText "This is a test." "en"

To speak the current text

  dcop kttsd kspeech startText

To stop speaking

  dcop kttsd kspeech stopText

Depending upon the speech plugin used, speaking may not immediately stop.

17 Mar 2004: The Festival plugin does not work for me.  Crashes as soon
as call to festival_initialize is made.  I suspect that the problem is
incompatible gcc compilers used to compile kttsd and the libfestival.a
static library, which on my system, is version 1.42.  So I added the
Festival (Interactive) plugin that interfaces with Festival interactively
via pipes ("festival --interactive").  If someone can confirm or deny
this, I'd be appreciative.. Gary Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>.

Festival (Client/Server), festivalcs, is not currently working.

Using with Festival Lite (flite)
--------------------------------
Obtain Festival Lite here:

  http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/index.html
  
Build and install following the instructions in the README that comes
with flite.

Start KTTSD settings dialog

  kcmshell kcmkttsd
  
Choose the Command plugin and enter the following as the command

  flite -t "%t"

Compiling the API docs
----------------------
If you are working from the CVS kdenonbeta module, to build the KTTSD API
documents using Doxygen, proceed as follows:

Add the following line (if not already present) to kdenonbeta/configure.in.in.

  KDE_INIT_DOXYGEN([The KDE API Reference], [Version $VERSION])

Then do the following commands.

  cd kdenonbeta
  make -f Makefile.cvs
  ./configure
  cd kttsd
  make apidox
  
You should now have the docs in kdenonbeta/apidocs/kttsd.
The KDE Speech API (API used by KDE applications to speak text) is in file
apidocs/kttsd/html/classkspeech.html.
