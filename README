KTTSD is the next Proklam.
The first difference is that KTTSD is implemented as a KDED module.
It is based on Proklam and depricates Proklam.

KTTSD, KDE Text To Speech Daemon is a plug-in based dcop service that
allows any KDE (or non-KDE) application to send messages using the
dcop interface that later will be spoken.

Features
--------
* Priority system for warnings and messages, while still playing regular texts.
* Long text is parsed into sentences.  User may backup by sentence or paragraph,
  replay, pause, and stop playing.
* Speak contents of clipboard.

Requirements
------------
KDE 3.2.x and a speech synthesis engine, such as Festival.  Festival can be
obtained from http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/.  Festival is
distributed with most Linux distros.  Check your distro CDs.  Also works
with Hadifax or any command that can speak text.

Building
--------
If you are building from CVS kdenonbeta module, the usual commands

  cd kdenonbeta
  echo kttsd > inst-apps
  make -f Makefile.cvs
  ./configure
  make
  make install  // as root

Before attempting to run QT Designer against plugin .ui files, first copy
kttsd/libkttsd/pluginconf.h to $KDEDIR/include/.
  
Using
-----
Make sure your speech engine is working.

You may need to grant Festival write access to the audio device.

  chmod a+rw /dev/dsp*

To configure the speech plugin for KTTSD

  kcmshell kcmkttsd

To run KTTSD

  kttsd

Click on the system tray icon.  Click "Open text to read out" button, 
pick a plain text file, then click "Start reading" button.

To set the text to be spoken

 dcop kttsd kspeech setText <text> <language>

where <text> is the text to be spoken, and <language> is a language code
such as "en", "cy", etc.

Example.

  dcop kttsd kspeech setText "This is a test." "en"

To speak the current text

  dcop kttsd kspeech startText

To stop speaking

  dcop kttsd kspeech stopText

Depending upon the speech plugin used, speaking may not immediately stop.

17 Mar 2004: The Festival plugin does not work for me.  Crashes as soon
as call to festival_initialize is made.  I suspect that the problem is
incompatible gcc compilers used to compile kttsd and the libfestival.a
static library, which on my system, is version 1.42.  So I added the
Festival (Interactive) plugin that interfaces with Festival interactively
via pipes ("festival --interactive").  If someone can confirm or deny
this, I'd be appreciative.. Gary Cramblitt <garycramblitt@comcast.net>.
The Force Arts option does not currently work with Festival (Interactive)
plugin.

Festival (Client/Server), festivalcs, is not currently working.
