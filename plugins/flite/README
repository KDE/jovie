This is the directory containing the Festival Lite plug in.
This plug in is developed and maintained by Gary Cramblitt.

If you intend to edit the GUI (fliteconfwidget.ui) you will have to first
copy /libkttsd/pluginconf.h to a standard include directory
like $KDEDIR/include/ since the interface has been tweaked to derive
from PlugInConf instead of QWidget and Qt Designer refuses to open it
if the header is not properly place.
