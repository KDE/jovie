This is the directory containing the Festival plug in.
If you intend to edit the GUI (festivalconfig.ui) you will have to first
copy kttsd/libkttsd/pluginconf.h to a standard include directory
like $KDEDIR/include/ since the interface has been tweaked to derive
from PlugInConf instead of QWidget and Qt Designer refuses to open it
if the header is not properly place.

Another important thing to do is tweak some festival headers.
EST_Chunk.h and EST_String.h both includes est_string_config.h if 
HAVE_CONFIG_H is defined (which is defined for porpuses of KDE).
est_string_config.h doesn't exist and that leads to a compilation
error so HAVE_CONFIG_H can be safely turned to XXXHAVE_CONFIG_H as
it may be in future releases of Festival.

	OK, HAVE_CONFIG_H that you are defining for your project
	is conflicting with speech_tools use of the variable the
	solution is to change speech_tools so it does not use
	HAVE_CONFIG_H

	This in

	include/EST_String.h
	include/EST_Chunk.h
	base_class/string/EST_Regex.cc

	Change 

	#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H 

	to 

	#ifdef XXXHAVE_CONFIG_H 

	I'll also try to find out why we even have that in our
	system as I can't se what it does (except potentially conflict with
	others.

	Alan
