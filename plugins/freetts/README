This is the directory containing the FreeTTS plug in.
If you intend to edit the GUI (freettsconfig.ui) you will have to first
copy kttsd/libkttsd/pluginconf.h to a standard include directory
like $KDEDIR/include/ since the interface has been tweaked to derive
from PlugInConf instead of QWidget and Qt Designer refuses to open it
if the header is not properly place.
