This is the directory containing the Festival (Interactive) plug in.
If you intend to edit the GUI (festivalintconfwidget.ui) you will have
to first copy kttsd/libkttsd/pluginconf.h to a standard include directory
like $KDEDIR/include/ since the interface has been tweaked to derive
from PlugInConf instead of QWidget and Qt Designer refuses to open it
if the header is not found.

Force Arts option is not currently working.  In the meantime, you can
turn off Force Arts, but make sure that Festival has write access to
the audio device

  chmod a+rw /dev/dsp*
