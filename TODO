_ There are several issues with i18n:
    _ Since kcmkttsmgr can be invoked from kttsmgr, kcmshell kcmkttsd, or KControl, do I
      need to call KLocale::setMainCatalogue?  Also, what about kttsjobmgr, which is kpart
      used in kcmkttsmr?
    _ FestivalInt plugin should be showing translated names of voices (Comment[xx] lines in
      voices file) based on user's desktop setting.  But a user with Spanish desktop says it isn't
      working.  Why?  Test with "KDE_LANG=es kttsmgr" command (but must have es installed).
      Apparently, this statement not working as expected: 
        voices.readEntry("Comment["+desktopLanguageCode+"]"
      i.e., cannot read language-specific strings from file.
    _ Need way to get translators to fill in rest of Comment[xx] lines in plugins/festivalint/voices
      file.  Or maybe just install different translated versions of voices file?
    _ The plugin Makefile.am's lack message targets, or should they just use kttsmgr catalog?
    _ I'm confused about this i18n stuff and could REALLY use some expert help..grc.
_ Festival Interactive plugin:
    _ Need someone to test the Finnish TTS to see if that is working correctly.
    _ Need someone who can read czech to try integrating this into KTTS:

_ KTTSMgr:
    _ Overall Audio Speed should be a realtime setting, i.e., not necessary to click Apply.
    _ Overall Audio Speed setting should be applied when using Test button in plugin Configure dialogs.
    _ Add drag N drop for the Talkers so it is easier to change the ordering.
    _ It is possible to configure multiple instances of Talkers with the exact same configuration.
    _ Add WhatsThis help.  The Jobs tab needs them.
    _ In kttsmgr jobs tab, if user has made changes but not applied them, and then clicks
      Speak Clipboard, Speak File, or Change Talker buttons, warn user to apply the changes first.
      Or maybe disable Jobs tab if changes are pending?
    _ In kcmkttsmgr, use setHelp() to set help anchor based on current tab.
    _ Add playback controls to kttsmgr.  Volume, pause.  Maybe rewind?
    _ In the job manager tab, one can drag the toolbars elsewhere, but the buttons
      disappear.  Why?
_ KTTSD:
    _ KTTSD should autoconfigure a Talker if there is no configured Talker that supports a requested
      language.  If no Talkers are configured at all, autoconfigure a Talker using the user's
      desktop language.  Must somehow let kttsmgr know about the newly configured Talker.
    _ Continue revision of KDE Speech API (kspeech.h).
    _ Add support for speech markers.
    _ Implement error signal handling in KTTSD.
    _ Add support for SSML, JSML, Sable and other Speech Markup languages.
    _ Add method for apps to play a sound file, including in the middle of a job.
      Could be done with SSML or with special Talker Code = "sound".
_ Remove kcm_kttsmgr once all apps (KSayIt) have stopped using it.
_ Add a plugin for TuxTalk, http://tuxtalk.sourceforge.net/.  Since it only supports
  English (at the moment) and is alpha, don't think it is worth it now.
_ Add a plugin for dhvani, an Indian and Hindi TTS engine, http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/
  Currently written in c, but it looks like future versions will require Java VM.
  Main problem at the moment is that dhvani sends audio directly to /dev/dsp with no option
  to send to a wav file.
_ Festival plugin (static library) crashes on first call to library.
_ Investigate what is involved in getting Gnopernicus screen reader to use KTTSD.
_ Command plugin crashes when using command 'flite -t "%t"' and flite can't get write access to /dev/dsp*.
_ IBM ViaVoice plugin?
_ When stopText() is called, and Hadifix process is killed, the temporary wav file is not deleted,
  despite QFile::remove call.  Possibly still locked by exiting mbrola process?  This only seems
  to happen in the configuration dialog when canceling Tests.
