_ Add WhatsThis help.  The Jobs tab and most of the plugin config dialogs need them.
_ KTTSD should autoconfigure a Talker if there is no configured Talker that supports a requested
  language.  If no Talkers are configured at all, autoconfigure a Talker using the user's
  desktop language.  Must somehow let kttsmgr know about the newly configured Talker.
_ In kttsmgr jobs tab, if user has made changes but not applied them, and then clicks
  Speak Clipboard, Speak File, or Change Talker buttons, warn user to apply the changes first.
  Or maybe disable Jobs tab if changes are pending?
_ In kcmkttsmgr, use setHelp() to set help anchor based on current tab.
_ Remove kcm_kttsmgr once all apps (KSayIt) have stopped using it.
_ Add a plugin for TuxTalk, http://tuxtalk.sourceforge.net/.  Since it only supports
  English (at the moment) and is alpha, don't think it is worth it now.
_ Add a plugin for dhvani, an Indian and Hindi TTS engine, http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/
  Currently written in c, but it looks like future versions will require Java VM.
- Add support for SSML, JSML, Sable and other Speech Markup languages.
- Continue revision of KDE Speech API (kspeech.h).
- Add support for speech markers.
- Finish Festival Client/Server plugin.
- Festival plugin (static library) crashes on first call to library.
- Investigate what is involved in getting Gnopernicus screen reader to use KTTSD.
- Command plugin crashes when using command 'flite -t "%t"' and flite can't get write access to /dev/dsp*.
- In the job manager tab of kttsmgr, one can drag the toolbars elsewhere, but the buttons
  disappear.  Why?
_ IBM ViaVoice plugin?
_ Add playback controls to kttsmgr.  Volume, pause.  Maybe rewind?
_ Implement error signal handling in KTTSD.
_ When GStreamer bindings become available, add as alternative to aRts.
  Note that gstreamer 0.6 has issues with .wav files.
