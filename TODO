_ Remove kcm_kttsmgr once all apps (KSayIt) have stopped using it.
_ Add a plugin for TuxTalk, http://tuxtalk.sourceforge.net/.  Since it only supports
  English (at the moment) and is alpha, don't think it is worth it now.
_ Add a plugin for dhvani, an Indian and Hindi TTS engine, http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/
  Currently written in c, but it looks like future versions will require Java VM.
- Standarize the .desktop files
- Improve language selection and management in the KTTSD's configuration. Languages added shouldn't be shown in the list of languages to add. Default languages should show only the current languages. Languages should be shown as names and not codes. Languages should be erased from the default language combo box.  If a plugin does not support a language, it should not be choosable.
- Add ability to configure more than one plugin for a language, but with different voices. Call them "talkers".
- Add support for XML::Sable and other Speech Markup languages.
- Continue revision of KDE Speech API (kspeech.h).
- Add support for speech markers.
- Add support for moving a text job to a different talker (language/plugin).
- Finish Festival Client/Server plugin.
- Festival plugin (static library) crashes on first call to library.
- Investigate what is involved in getting Gnopernicus screen reader to use KTTSD.
- Command plugin crashes when using command 'flite -t "%t"' and festival can't get write access to /dev/dsp*.
- In the job manager tab of kttsmgr, one can drag the toolbars elsewhere, but the buttons
  disappear.  Why?
_ IBM ViaVoice plugin?
_ Add playback controls to kttsmgr.  Volume, pause.  Maybe rewind?
_ Implement error signal handling in KTTSD.
_ Add option not to have system tray icon in kttsmgr.

Widgets needed; useful for whole KDE:
- Language selection widgets, configurable and versatile.
- A good password line edit which will allow to set the password.
- A Tab Widget with buttons on the tab to close (remove) the tabs (ala Konversation).
