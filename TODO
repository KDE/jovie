_ Epos plugin should default to ISO 8859-2 encoding, rather than Local (whatever)?
  It seems to work with UTF-8, Latin1, and ISO 8859-2.  Why, it shouldn't work if
  encoding is Latin1 (ISO 8859-1), but it does?
_ The khmtlktts plugin should automatically sense if KTTSD is installed and if not,
  hide menu item.  If installed, but not configured, prompt user to run kttsmgr.
_ Clean up kspeech/kspeechsink api documentation for kdelibs.
_ Audio Plugins:
    _ The Audio plugins are loaded by calling KTrader with Name=<name in .desktop file>.
      Since the desktop files are translated, is this a problem??  Works when I do
      KDE_LANG=es kttsmgr, but I am still not sure.
    _ Why must Player constructor take a 3rd "args" argument, while PluginProc constructor
      does not.  They are essentially the same. ??
_ There are several issues with i18n:
    _ Since kcmkttsmgr can be invoked from kttsmgr, kcmshell kcmkttsd, or KControl, do I
      need to call KLocale::setMainCatalogue?  Also, what about kttsjobmgr, which is kpart
      used in kcmkttsmr?
    _ The plugin Makefile.am's lack message targets, or should they just use kttsmgr catalog?
    _ The Makefile.am HOWTO seems to imply that messages target should only appear in
      top-level directory. ??  Furthermore it seems to say .pot filename must match
      application/part/module. ??
    _ I'm confused about this i18n stuff and could REALLY use some expert help..grc.
_ Festival Interactive plugin:
    _ Need someone who can read czech to try integrating this into KTTS: 
      http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-czech
_ KTTSMgr:
    _ A user had $HOME/festival directory and FestivalInt plugin used this path.  Need to
      check that auto found path is an actual executable file somehow.
    _ GUI problems with latest kdelibs (HEAD 12/2004).  Can't size screen smaller than total
      of headers in Talker KListView.  When restoring from system tray icon, tab widget
      doesn't resize to full screen.  Size screen and it resizes.
    _ When speaking SSML, the window expands to maximum height to accomodate displaying the
      "Current Sentence", which is all of the SSML.  Annoying.  Better to not expand and display
      vertical scrollbar.
    _ Overall Audio Speed should be a realtime setting, i.e., not necessary to click Apply.
    _ Disable Audio Speed control if sox not installed (configure.in.in but runtime check would be better).
    _ Add drag N drop for the Talkers so it is easier to change the ordering.
    _ It is possible to configure multiple instances of Talkers with the exact same configuration.
    _ Add WhatsThis help.  The Jobs tab needs them.
    _ In kttsmgr jobs tab, if user has made changes but not applied them, and then clicks
      Speak Clipboard, Speak File, or Change Talker buttons, warn user to apply the changes first.
      Or maybe disable Jobs tab if changes are pending?
    _ In kcmkttsmgr, use setHelp() to set help anchor based on current tab.
    _ Add playback controls to kttsmgr.  Volume, pause.  Maybe rewind?
    _ In the job manager tab, one can drag the toolbars elsewhere, but the buttons
      disappear.  Why?
_ KTTSD:
    _ KTTSD should autoconfigure a Talker if there is no configured Talker that supports a requested
      language.  If no Talkers are configured at all, autoconfigure a Talker using the user's
      desktop language.  Must somehow let kttsmgr know about the newly configured Talker.
    _ Continue revision of KDE Speech API (kspeech.h).
    _ Add support for speech markers.
    _ Implement error signal handling in KTTSD.
    _ Add support for SSML, JSML, Sable and other Speech Markup languages.
      _ Allow sentence parsing in combination with SSML markup so that users can advance,
        rewind, etc.
    _ Add method for apps to play a sound file, including in the middle of a job.
      Could be done with SSML or with special Talker Code = "sound".
_ Convert to KConfig XT.
_ Add option to automatically turn down music player volume while speaking (via dcop).
_ Add a plugin for TuxTalk, http://tuxtalk.sourceforge.net/.  Since it only supports
  English (at the moment) and is alpha, don't think it is worth it now.
_ Add a plugin for dhvani, an Indian and Hindi TTS engine, http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/
  Currently written in c, but it looks like future versions will require Java VM.
  Main problem at the moment is that dhvani sends audio directly to /dev/dsp with no option
  to send to a wav file.
_ Festival plugin (static library) crashes on first call to library.
_ Investigate what is involved in getting Gnopernicus screen reader to use KTTSD.
_ Command plugin crashes when using command 'flite -t "%t"' and flite can't get write access to /dev/dsp*.
_ IBM ViaVoice plugin?
_ When stopText() is called, and Hadifix process is killed, the temporary wav file is not deleted,
  despite QFile::remove call.  Possibly still locked by exiting mbrola process?  This only seems
  to happen in the configuration dialog when canceling Tests.
