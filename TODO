_ Filters:
    _ Change TalkerChooser filter to use new SelectTalker dialog.
    _ Although one can configure Canadian English voice in Festival, there is no way to choose
      Canadian English in the Talker Chooser.
    _ XHTMLtoSSML stylesheet needs work to provide better mappings for most web pages.
    _ Add KNewStuff capability for folks to upload/download filter configs.
_ Audio Plugins:
    _ Why must Player constructor take a 3rd "args" argument, while PluginProc constructor
      does not.  They are essentially the same. ??
    _ Add option to automatically turn down music player volume while speaking (via dcop).
_ Festival Interactive plugin:
    _ Festival crashes on really long sentences.  Even if it doesn't crash, it drones on lower and
      lower in tone.  Need to detect really long sentences and try to break at comma.
    _ Need someone who can read czech to try integrating this into KTTS: 
      http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-czech
_ Command plugin:
    _ Command plugin encodes text on command line using %t in user's chosen encoding, but
      if this differs from user's desktop default encoding, doesn't work.  KProcess always
      encodes command line stuff using user's default encoding.  There is no point, therefore,
      in attempting to encode it differently, just mangles the text even more.  Short of modifying
      KProcess, I see no way around this.  But perhaps a warning to user advising to use %f instead?
    _ Command plugin crashes when using command 'flite -t "%t"' and flite can't get write access to /dev/dsp*.
_ Hadifix plugin:
    _ When stopText() is called, and Hadifix process is killed, the temporary wav file is not deleted,
      despite QFile::remove call.  Possibly still locked by exiting mbrola process?  This only seems
      to happen in the configuration dialog when canceling Tests.
_ KTTSMgr:
    _ The Select Talker dialog sizes too large.  There are two problems.  1) The KListView has too
      many rows.  2) KDialogBase doesn't size large enough to contain the SelectTalkerWidget.
      For now, have called setInitSize(700, 600), but that is too large for an 800x600 screen.
    _ If the Resume button is accidentally clicked twice, it restarts a paused job from the beginning.
      According to the API, resumeText() will restart a job that is already speaking.  Either the
      API should be changed, or the Resume button should be disabled for speaking jobs.
    _ Give Talkers a Talker Name entered by user.  Show this name in Jobs tab, Change Talker screen,
      and in systray menu.
    _ Change the Current Sentence panel to show the current sentence of the selected job?  If selected
      job is not the currently speaking job, won't show currently-speaking text anymore.  However, would
      be helpful when using advance/rewind buttons.  Perhaps to be effective, if the currently-selected
      job IS the currently speaking job, and that job finishes, would automatically select the next
      speaking job?  But that could become confusing for users with selection jumping around.
    _ Add ability to quickly pick default Talker in systray menu.
    _ KCMultiDialog has a bug that won't allow sizing the screen narrower than 640.
    _ When speaking SSML, the window expands to maximum height to accomodate displaying the
      "Current Sentence", which is all of the SSML.  Annoying.  Better to not expand and display
      vertical scrollbar.
    _ Overall Audio Speed should be a realtime setting, i.e., not necessary to click Apply.
    _ Disable Audio Speed control if sox not installed (configure.in.in but runtime check would be better).
    _ Add drag N drop for the Talkers so it is easier to change the ordering.
    _ It is possible to configure multiple instances of Talkers with the exact same configuration.
    _ In kcmkttsmgr, use setHelp() to set help anchor based on current tab.
    _ Add playback controls to kttsmgr.  Volume, pause.  Maybe rewind?
_ KTTSD:
    _ Strange msg being produced by KIO::move, but it works fine. ??
        kio (KIOJob): stat file:///home/kde-devel/.kde/share/apps/kttsd/audio/kttsd-5-1.wav
        kio (KIOJob): error 11 /home/kde-devel/.kde/share/apps/kttsd/audio/kttsd-5-1.wav
        kio (KIOJob): This seems to be a suitable case for trying to rename before stat+[list+]copy+del
    _ While kttsd currently configures a Talker automatically, would be nice if it could
      autoconfigure talkers for each requested language, if one has not already been configured.
    _ Add support for speech markers.
    _ Implement error signal handling in KTTSD.
    _ Add support for JSML and other Speech Markup languages.
    _ Add method for apps to play a sound file, including in the middle of a job.
      Could be done with SSML or with special Talker Code = "sound".
_ Other/General:
    _ Save buttons should confirm if user chooses an existing file.  KFileDialog doesn't seem to
      offer this option, but shouldn't it?
    _ .desktop files must have a Type keyword, but what to use for kcmkttsd_testmessage.desktop?
    _ Add option to kill plugin process when no longer needed so that memory can be recovered.
      Or maybe some sort of "nice" setting so that process will be swapped out when no longer needed.
    _ Convert to KConfig XT.
    _ Add a plugin for TuxTalk, http://tuxtalk.sourceforge.net/.  Since it only supports
      English (at the moment) and is alpha, don't think it is worth it now.
    _ Add a plugin for dhvani, an Indian and Hindi TTS engine, http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/
      Currently written in c, but it looks like future versions will require Java VM.
      Main problem at the moment is that dhvani sends audio directly to /dev/dsp with no option
      to send to a wav file.
    _ Investigate what is involved in getting Gnopernicus screen reader to use KTTSD.
    _ IBM ViaVoice plugin?
    _ Add KTTS plugin to aKregator.
